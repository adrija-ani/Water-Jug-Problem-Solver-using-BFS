# Water Jug Problem Solver using BFS

## About
This Python program implements the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to solve the water jug problem. The problem involves two jugs of different capacities, and the goal is to measure exactly a specific amount of water using a series of operations. The program outputs the solution path and the associated cost.

## How to Use
1. Define the capacities of the two jugs (x and y) and the target amount (z).
2. Run the program to find a sequence of actions that results in exactly z liters in the first jug.
3. The program will display the path taken, the cost of the operations, and whether a solution is found.

## Example
For jugs with capacities of 4 liters and 3 liters, and a target of 2 liters, the program finds the solution and prints:
- The state of the jugs at each step.
- The sequence of actions taken.
- The cost of reaching the solution.
